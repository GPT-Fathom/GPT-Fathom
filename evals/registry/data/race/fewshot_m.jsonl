{"passage": "It is well-known that the \"prom\", a formal dance held at the end of high school or college, is an important date in every student's life. What is less well-known is that the word \"prom\" comes from the verb \"to promenade\", which means to walk around, beautifully dressed, in order to attract attention. The idea is that you should see and be seen by others.\nThe prom is not just an American tradition, though most people believe that it started in America. In Canada the event is called a \"formal\". In Britain and Australia the old fashioned word \"dance\" is more and more frequently being referred to as a \"prom\". Most countries have some form of celebration when students finish high school: after all, it means the end of life as a child, and the beginning of life as an adult.\nThe prom is expensive to organize and the tickets can cost students a lot of money. The tradition is that students themselves have to raise the money to pay for it. Selling the students newspapers is one way to raise money; so is taking a part-time job at the weekend.\nAlthough the prom should be the experience of a lifetime, it also worries many students. There is the problem of what to wear, who to take as your partner, who will be voted \"prom queen\", etc. And it is not only students who feel worried. What many parents find difficult is the realization that their children's school days are almost over.

Kites for work or play are made of wood, bamboo, paper, or silk. In 478 B.C., a Chinese philosopher , Mo Zi, spent three years making a kite out of light wood and bamboo. The earliest record of kite flying was in about 200 B.C. when the Chinese General  Han Xin of Han Dynasty flew a kite over the walls of a city. He wanted to know how far his army would have to travel.\nIn the 13thcentury, Marco Polo wrote about how the shipping businessmen flew the huge kite in the wind before the ship set sail. They predicted the voyage  in this way. If the kite went high and straight it meant a quick and successful voyage, but if it did not fly well, it was a bad omen . In the late 1500s, the kite was introduced to Europe by the Italians.
