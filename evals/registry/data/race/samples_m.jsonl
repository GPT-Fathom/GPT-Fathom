Walking causes very injuries, so there is also a lower \"dropout\" rate among walkers than among runners.\nPeople are more likely to continue a walking program. This gives a better chance for success. Walking offers some mental benefits, too. It seems to make people feel better. Many walkers say they sleep better at night when they take regular walks. Others say they have a better attitude towards life. Walking offers many of the same physical and mental benefits as other forms of exercise, but walking offers some special advantages, too.

They look for food all day long, and in the evening you can see them in large numbers flying back to their nests  in the trees. They sleep there at night.\nCrows are much noisier than other birds. Very often a large number of crows will get together on one house and talk. Sometimes they talk together, and sometimes they do it by turns like human beings . It is easy to tell from  crows' sounds whether they are pleased or angry. Perhaps crows talk a lot because they are friendly birds.

Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \"train-spotter\" in Britain is related to \"geek\" or \"nerd\" (someone who seems very ridiculous). But is this reputation really deserved?\nFirst of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down. The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country.\nBeing crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars?\nSo, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment  includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food.\nIt's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps. There is evidence, too, that being a train-spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain.\nOne glance at the US train stations should be enough to convince you that train-spotters there are alive and well. In America, they try to call rail lovers \"train-fans\" and talk of \"train-fanning\". Don't let this fool you--these people are train spotters and there are a lot of them.

{"passage": "Dear Boris,\nThanks for your nice letter.\nAfter I had spent a week with my English family, I slowly began to understand their English a little better. It's very different from what I learned at school! Students in my group are from different cities of Britain and their dialects   are different too! Some of their accents   are quite strong and they also have their own words and expressions.\nBut it's not the language that's different and surprising. Before I came to England I had thought that fish and chips were eaten every day. That's quite wrong! I get rather mad now when I hear all the foolish words about typical   English food.\nI had expected to see \"London fog\". Do you remember our texts about it? We had no idea that most of this 'thick fog' disappeared many years ago when people stopped using coal in their homes. But the idea to speak about the weather was very helpful. The weather in London is really changeable.\nOn the other hand habits are different. People tell me what is typically British here in London is not always typical in Wales or Scotland. Local habits and traditions are not the same as what we knew.\nBut what is ordinary for all British is that they follow traditions. Probably Britain has more living signs of its past than many other countries.

{"passage": "Music education hasn't changed much since the 1970s. Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\nThe experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.\nThe key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever.

The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs.\nOne of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District.

{"passage": "How much should you save? You may be able to save 100% of your money. Does that mean you should? Not at all. The best way to develop good saving habits is to make saving a regular part of your life, along with spending.\nHere is the rule you should remember: save before spending. Whenever some money gets into your hands, from a job or your pocket money or whatever, take your savings out immediately, before spending any of the money. The beauty of this system is that if you take away your savings, you are free to spend the rest.\nHere are some more suggestions on how to successfully get into the saving habit from teens. Let's see!\nTony,13: I put my money in a bank instead of my wallet, so the money is not there. And I have to take an extra step to get it.\nBill,14: When considering a major purchase , wait a week or so, at least. This will help you make sure if you still want it, and the price might go down.\nDick, 13: Carry very little money always. You can't spend money if you don't have it. A cake would be nice, but without a dollar, you can't get it. Little things like that really add up quickly.\nSteve,16: I used to be weak when it came to money. I bought something whenever I went into a store. I'm glad I'm not that person now. I taught myself discipline by keeping a $20 bill in my pocket while waking around the mall all day and not buying anything. Now I have no strong wish to buy things when I go into a store. It works for me.\nThese ideas should help you get started.

Each of these groups has its own number, such as 100, 200, etc. So, for example, any books about language will have a number 400. On the other hand, any books about history will have a number 900. So, a number in the hundreds place tells you what general group a book is in. If you find a book that has a number in the 500s, you know it is a book about science.\nHowever, science is a big group, so the tens place is used to make a more detailed set of science books. For example, math books are included in the group of science books. Math books all have numbers between 510 and 519. Books about the history of Africa have numbers between 960 and 969.\nThe system uses the ones place to give a more exact limit for the subject of a book.
