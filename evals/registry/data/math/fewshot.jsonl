{"question": "Find the domain of the expression $\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.", "answer": "The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct."}
{"question": "If $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$", "answer": "We have that $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct."}
{"question": "Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?", "answer": "If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight. \n                If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight. \n                Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$: \n                \\begin{align*} \n                30n&=480\\\\ \n                \\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16} \n                \\end{align*} \n                Final Answer: The final answer is $16$.
