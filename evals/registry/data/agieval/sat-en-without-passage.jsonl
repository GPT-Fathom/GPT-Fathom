Meanwhile, in the last sentence of Passage 2, Bryan cautions, \"We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here\"; in other words, imperial expansion by the United States would erode a key American value. Therefore, the difference between how the speakers view liberty as it is realized in the United States is that Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify the conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.Choice A is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't present the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as the direct inheritance of European colonization. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't argue that the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States arose organically as the country matured; instead, both Beveridge and Bryan emphasize the divinely inspired, intrinsic nature of the American concept of liberty.

If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect.

She asserts that as moral beings all people have the same inherent rights and states that \"the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman\" (lines 66-68).Choice $A$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not discuss the practical difficulties of something that is proposed in Passage 1 but rather argues against the main point of Passage 1 . Choice $C$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not provide historical context for the view expressed in Passage 1; the passages were published at around the same time and both discuss contemporary society.

While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman's role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society. In Passage 1 , Beecher writes that \"while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading\" (lines 6-10). She suggests that women do have an obligation to use their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society.

She concludes that \"whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do\" (lines 81-83).Choice $B$ is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither passage discusses the value given to women's ethical obligations, although both authors suggest that women do have ethical and moral obligations.

Choice B is incorrect because even if the passage represents the \"moral purity\" of children, it does so only indirectly and not as a major theme.

As a whole, the passage can therefore be seen as a discussion of the biological motivation behind migrating birds' reliance on the $V$ formation.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the squadrons of planes mentioned in the second paragraph are used as an example to discuss migrating birds but are not themselves the main subject of this passage. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the fourth paragraph does discuss the role of downdrafts in V-formation flight, this discussion is brief and does not constitute a main purpose.

In the first paragraph of Passage 2, Mill suggests that social roles are resistant to change in part because of their being entrenched in the cultural tradition: \"for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated.\" In the context of a discussion of equality between men and women, Mill's statement serves to imply that gender roles change so slowly precisely because they are so deeply ingrained in society and culture.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although Mill suggests in Passage 2 that gender roles are deeply entrenched, she does not imply that they serve as the foundation of society. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not address the issue of legislative reforms, only societal ones.

The first two paragraphs of the passage describe the physical process by which the Venus flytrap closes its trap but also note certain long-standing questions about that process: \"How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?\" The passage then answers those questions by discussing, in the third and fourth paragraphs, a study conducted by Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers that identified the physiological means behind the closing of the Venus flytrap's trap and, in the last paragraph, a study conducted by Alexander Volkov that confirmed and built on Hodick and Sievers's findings. The primary purpose of the passage can therefore be seen as discussing scientific findings that explain how the Venus flytrap closes its trap.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't discuss the Venus flytrap's ability to close its trap in the context of the abilities of other plants. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the passage discusses how the closing action operates but not how it has evolved.

Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it."}}

The fourth paragraph explains that the Venus flytrap will close only if a second hair is stimulated to \"push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.\" But the last sentence of the paragraph notes that the calcium concentrations \"dissipate over time,\" and if enough time elapses after the first trigger, \"the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap.\" It can be inferred, then, that if a large insect didn't touch a second trigger hair until after the calcium ion concentrations had diminished appreciably, the Venus flytrap would fail to close. Choice $A$ is incorrect because the fourth paragraph makes clear that if the calcium concentration goes above the trap's threshold, the plant will close, not remain open. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because as the third paragraph explains, the touching of the trigger hair and opening of the calcium ion channels don't act to keep the trap open but are instead a precondition for the closing of the trap (though closing will occur only if a second trigger hair is touched). Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence of the fifth paragraph explains that the threshold for the time that can elapse between the touching of the first and second trigger hairs is twenty seconds, meaning that a large insect touching two hairs within ten seconds would almost certainly make the plant close."}}

As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which \"made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs.\" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is impossible to know from the passage if Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methods.

The second sentence of the last paragraph says that the focus of Volkov's work was the role of electricity in the Venus flytrap's closing mechanism. The paragraph goes on to explain that by applying electricity directly to the plant and \"altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.\" It is therefore accurate to say that Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of information obtained from measuring the plant's response to varying amounts of electrical current.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov's work was based on Hodick and Sievers's mathematical model in which an electrical charge is required to close the Venus flytrap, that model isn't described as predicting the precise amount of charge required; moreover, although Volkov made use of this earlier model, it served as a starting point, and his work made greater use of the findings generated by his experiment. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't describe Volkov's work as having involved analysis of data from earlier studies on the plant's response to electricity. Choice $\\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov based his work on Hodick and Sievers's earlier model, this was the sole model that Volkov relied on, and there is no suggestion that he made use of multiple \"published theories\" or \"earlier models\"; moreover, he made more extensive use of data generated by his own experiment than of Hodick and Sievers's model."}}

Her father praises the color, sound, and smell of an ink sample as indicators of the ink's quality. This interaction leads the narrator to conclude in the last paragraph, \"I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.\" Therefore, the passage is best summarized as a character's visit to her family's ink shop that deepens her appreciation of her family's work.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator's arrival at her family's ink shop does spark memories of her Precious Auntie, these memories center on Precious Auntie's beliefs about creativity, including the conviction that inferior ink produces inferior thought. The narrator's thoughts on Precious Auntie occur in the fourth paragraph, so choice A isn't the best summary of the overall passage. Choice B is incorrect. Although the passage describes the narrator's surprise visit to the ink shop and a reunion with her uncles, these events occur in the first paragraph.

In the third paragraph, she wonders how women can \"have no interest\" in the subject of slavery when it could lead to the destruction of their families through war. In the last paragraph, she asks women numerous questions and then answers them with a \"no.\" Thus, a technique that Smith uses throughout the passage to advance her main point is to present her claims in the form of rhetorical questions that mostly have implicit negative answers.Choice B is incorrect. Although Smith questions the assertions that her opponents made, she doesn't criticize her opponents themselves by quoting self-contradictory remarks they have made.

The author mentions gram-negative bacteria in the third paragraph to highlight teixobactin's ineffectiveness in combating it, not to discuss other antibiotics that are effective against gram-negative bacteria.Choice B is incorrect because the author wouldn't likely agree with the statement that the development of teixobactin shows that conventional methods can still yield new types of antibiotics. Instead, the author contends that the unconventional method used to produce teixobactin may yield new types of antibiotics.

The modern audience, in other words, wants to hear not only the stories a news organization produces but also the values that form the foundation of that organization's beliefs.Choices A, B, and $C$ are incorrect because lines 33-38 make clear that the expectation traditional authorities now face is the need to \"make explicit the frames of value which determine their decisions,\" not that they shouldn't be affected by commercial interests (choice A), that they should work for the common good (choice B), or that they should consider the context of public versus private knowledge (choice C)."}}

The passage explains that although the major news organizations were once considered \"trusted shapers\" (line 29) of public knowledge, that perception is changing due to the \"growing feeling ... that the news media should be 'informative rather than authoritative'; the job of journalists should be to 'give the news as raw as it is, without putting their slant on it'; and people should be given 'sufficient information' from which 'we would be able to form opinions of our own'\" (lines 70-77). In other words, the audience now wants raw facts about the world, not facts constructed in support of a certain opinion.Choice $B$ is incorrect because the passage presents the public as wanting information without any slant on it, not as wanting only a limited amount of information. Choices $C$ and $D$ are incorrect because the passage does not specifically identify the public's feelings about including quotations from authorities in news stories or how they would want journalists to handle private details that the subjects of news stories do not want revealed."}}

The passage states that by using the smell of their nectar to lure pollinators like bees, Texas gourd vines are employing an \" \"open communication network\" that attracts \" not just the good guys, but ... also ... the bad guys'\" (lines 7-10). Because cucumber beetles are then identified as some of \"the very bad guys\" (line 12) as far as the Texas gourd plant is concerned, it can be inferred that both the beetles and the bees are attracted to the same scent. Choices $A$ and $C$ are incorrect because they are not supported by the text; the passage states that cucumber beetles \"chew up pollen and petals\" (lines 12-13) from the Texas gourd vines but not that those vines are their \"primary\" food source, and the passage does not address any effects, positive or negative, that cucumber beetles experience as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the passage states that treating the Texas gourd vines with dimethoxybenzene led to \"double the normal number of beetles\" (lines 65-66) but that pollinators like bees \"did not prefer\" (line 67) the treated flowers, which implies that cucumber beetles are not less attracted but more attracted to dimethoxybenzene than honey bees are."}}

The author indicates that it is reasonable to think that the Texas gourd plants might lure more pollinators if their smell was stronger. This is clear from lines 26-27, which state that \"intuition suggests that more of that aroma should be even more appealing to bees.\"Choices $A$ and $D$ are incorrect because lines $26-27$ support the idea that it was initially thought that Texas gourd vines could lure more pollinators through \"more of that aroma,\" not by lacking an aroma (choice (A)or giving off a more varied aroma (choice D).

Theis and Adler's research clearly provided an answer to the question of why there is an upper limit on the intensity of the aroma emitted by Texas gourd plants, as their experiment was described as being able to \"provide a reason that Texas gourd plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent\" (lines 85-86).Choice $A$ is incorrect because Theis and Adler's research was not able to show how to increase pollinator visits to the Texas gourd vine, as the results of their experiment showed that \"pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the highly scented flowers\" (lines 67-68). Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Theis and Adler's research was not able to explain how hand pollination rescued fruit weight, a finding the passage describes as \"a hard-to-interpret result\" (line 83).

In Passage 1 , Lincoln asserts that citizens of the United States should never break the laws of their land, for any reason, because to do so undermines the nation's values. This is clearly demonstrated when he says, \"let every man remember that to violate the law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the character of his own, and his children's liberty\" (lines 9-12). Choice A is incorrect because Lincoln says that bad laws \"should be repealed as soon as possible\" (line 30), not that breaking the law would slow their repeals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because Lincoln says that \"there is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law\" (lines 36-37) but doesn't argue that breaking the law will lead to mob rule.

Passage 2 begins with Thoreau's statement that \"unjust laws exist\" (line 45). His philosophy regarding how to deal with those unjust laws is evident in lines 58-59: \"If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go.\" Thoreau believes, in other words, that some injustices are an unfortunate part of normal governance and just need to be endured (\"let it go, let it go\").Choice $A$ is incorrect because Thoreau does not say some unjust aspects of government can be fixed easily or that they are merely superficial. Choice $B$ is incorrect because Thoreau does not argue that such injustices are subtle and should be studied, but rather that in certain cases it is best to \"let it go, let it go\" (line 59), while in other cases one should act or \"break the law\" (line 66). Choice C is incorrect because Thoreau does not say that any such unjust aspects of government are beneficial or helpful."}}
{"passage": null, "question": "The primary purpose of each passage is to", "options": ["(A)make an argument about the difference between legal duties and moral imperatives.", "(B)discuss how laws ought to be enacted and changed in a democracy.", "(C)advance a view regarding whether individuals should follow all of the country’s laws.", "(D)articulate standards by which laws can be evaluated as just or unjust."], "label": "C", "other": {"solution": "Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Lincoln makes clear his belief that individuals should always heed the laws: \"Let every American ... swear ... never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the country\" (lines 1-4). Even bad laws, he states, \"while they continue in force, for the sake of example, they should be religiously observed\" (lines 30-32). In Passage 2, Thoreau is less rigid in his beliefs regarding the need for individuals to heed the laws of the country, arguing at times that some laws should be broken: \"but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law\" (lines 64-66). While Lincoln and Thoreau can therefore be said to disagree about the moral imperative to follow existing laws, both passages advance an opinion regarding the need to follow or not follow all of the country's laws.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passages are not making arguments about differences between legal duties and moral imperatives but rather are addressing the need to follow (or not) the laws of a land. Choice B is incorrect. Both passages address the question of changing existing laws in the United States, but that is only a minor part of what is a greater debate about the need to follow or not follow existing laws. Choice $D$ is incorrect because neither passage addresses the standards for determining whether or not laws are just, only whether laws should be heeded or not."}}
{"passage": null, "question": "Based on the passages, one commonality in the stancesLincoln and Thoreau take toward abolitionism is that", "options": ["(A)both authors see the cause as warranting drastic action.", "(B)both authors view the cause as central to their argument.", "(C)neither author expects the cause to win widespread acceptance.", "(D)neither author embraces the cause as his own."], "label": "D", "other": {"solution": "Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1, Lincoln uses abolitionism solely as an example to illustrate the argument he is making about heeding the law: \"In any case that arises, as for instance, the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two positions is necessarily true\" (lines 37-39). In Passage 2, Thoreau does the same thing by noting that \"those who call themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually withdraw their support ... from the government\" (lines 79-82). Although Lincoln and Thoreau use the cause of abolitionism to argue different points, a commonality they share is that neither embraces the cause personally in the passage; Lincoln simply uses it as an example (\"as for instance\") while Thoreau specifically talks of other people \"who call themselves Abolitionists.\" Choice $A$ is incorrect because in Passage 1, Lincoln argues against drastic action, saying that even in the case of abolitionism, such a response is not \"necessary, justifiable, or excusable\" (line 44). Choice B is incorrect because it's not accurate to say abolitionism was central to the arguments, only that each used that subject as an example. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither Lincoln nor Thoreau offers an opinion about whether or not abolitionism will gain widespread acceptance, instead they incorporate it only as an example in their discussions of just and unjust laws."}}

The passage concludes by stating that \"the challenge is to produce good connections between these semiconductors, something made challenging by the arrangement of silicon atoms in crystalline silicon\" (lines 81-84). As this last sentence identifies an issue the solar panel industry still faces, and describes it as a \"challenging\" one at that, it mainly serves to identify a problem or hurdle that must be dealt with by the industry.Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the main point of the passage's last sentence is that there is a \"challenge\" or hurdle that the solar panel industry has to deal with; it doesn't express concerns about what a material won't be able to do (choice A), make predictions (choice C), or introduce a new idea for study (choice D)."}}
