      "Correct": The submitted SQL and the expert answer are semantically the same, i.e. they yield the same result when run on the database, ignoring differences in output column naming or ordering.
      "Incorrect": The submitted SQL and the expert answer are semantically different, i.e. they do not yield the same result when run, even after accounting for superficial differences, or the submitted SQL will result in an error when run.
